	Boston Rally for Julian Assange on Monday, July 24th outside the Charles Street
	train station.
      </h3>

<!-- Instead of deleting past advocacies and activist announcements, 
some keepers, if not all, can go here, inside the html comments:

	 We will gather at Park St. Station for our next rally for Julian Assange
	 Monday, May 22 from 11 to 12 then go to Black Seed Cafe to write letters to
	 Congress, the DoJ and the press.  I hope you can join us.

	This Julian Assange rally will be
	at the May Day rally, Monday, May 1, at 5 pm
	at the bandstand on the Boston Common.

... Government Center in front of the JFK Building, 
where our senators have their offices. At 12:00 walk
to Park St Station (in the Common) and continue there until 1:00pm.

Our next rally for Julian Assange is Saturday, March 4 at 11:30 to
12:30pm.  We will gather at Park St. Station on the Boston Common to speak
out for Assange and gather signatures on our petition to our senators.</br>
(<a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/03/alternative-facts-how-the-media-failed-julian-assange/">See how the media failed Julian Assange</a> at Harper's Magazine.)


	Thursday, February 23 at 6:30,
	at the Community Church of Boston at 565 Boylston St, Boston (Copley Sq):
	a panel discussion,
	"The Future of Gen Z Journalism Depends on Julian Assange's Freedom",
	on how the Julian Assange case will impact the future of journalism.
	<p>
	  This event is part of the fifth annual <em>Student Press Freedom Day</em> initiative
	  &lt;<a href="https://studentpressfreedom.org">https://studentpressfreedom.org</a>&gt;.
	<p>
	  I am not involved personally.

	‘First Night Against the Wars’ is coming up.  Let's have our next stand-out
for Julian starting at 2pm on Dec 31 in *Copley Sq*. at the corner of
Boylston and Dartmouth, in front of Trinity Church.  We are expecting
more activists this year as we join forces with Boston’s new coalition
‘Solidarity Action Network’. The coalition group will be gathering from
noon to 5, bringing all our issues together, crushing inequality, climate
collapse, endless war, nuclear Armageddon and, of course, free speech! It
grew out of the Earth Day Strike a few months back.

	Vote for Sanders 
	<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/05/14/sanders-campaign-was-about-us-not-bernie-remember">in your state's Democratic primary</a>.
	It is important to win him more delegates even though he won't win the
	nomination that way.  Besides, if Biden's various problems knock him
	out, Sanders might yet be nominated.

     <h3><a href="#oughttobe" id="oughttobe">There Ought to Be a Law</a></h3>
     <!--  

Insructions in a nutshell:

Only 4 list items are wanted here.  If you add a new list item to the top of
this file, then please *move* the oldest list item at the bottom over to:

    ~/public_html/there-ought-to-be-a-law.html 

Thanks.

Here is the detailed version.

The list items in this file are presented on the main page of stallman.org,
/index.html.  So it shouldn't take up too much page space.  Four texts is the
current desired limit. 

New texts should be added to this file at the top of the list 
as new list items with an id attribute of your choosing.

Old list items should then be subtracted from the bottom of this list, and moved
from here to the top of the list in /there-ought-to-be-a-law.html.  

No info is lost. The stallman.org URL 

    /there-ought-to-be-a-law.html

links to the whole version, the master list of laws that ought to be.  It
renders the entire list because it is set up to transclude the list items in
this file:

    /common/ought-to-be-a-law.html
    
putting the items in this file at the top.

The front page offers the link text "More items where there ought to be a law".
This takes you to the whole version. When viewed in your text editor, then:

    /common/ought-to-be-a-law  (this primary receiving file, the head file)
    /there-ought-to-be-a-law   (the secondary receiving file, body file)

in newest-first order.

      There should be a law requiring online services, if they close a
      user's account, to <a href="https://www.stallman.org/notes/2022-jul-oct.html#3_September_2022_(Google_canceled_account_over_photo_sent_to_a_doctor)">permit the user to continue to download whatever
      information perse had left in the account</a>.
    <p>
      To be sure, it is foolish to rely on an online service to hold any
      data for you; you should store it locally, and use online services
      only as backups (encrypted).  Preferably more than one online service
      in parallel, for redundancy.  But we should not allow online services
      to cite this as an excuse for arbitrarily causing people great
      avoidable harm.

    <p>
      The extreme of this is represented by the Amazon warehouse,
      where a worker's every move is controlled by the computer system.
      This is one of <a href="/amazon.html">many reasons to refuse to buy from Amazon</a>.
    <p>
      Unfortunately, surveillance of workers is not limited to Amazon.  I
      think states should pass laws to limit surveillance of workers.  It
      should cover independent contractors as well as employees.
    <p>
      The law should completely forbid demanding that workers run any
      specific software on their own computers (keep in mind that portable
      phones are computers); the employer who wants that must furnish
      the computer at no charge.

<dt><h3><a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2023-may-aug.html#23_August_2023_(Vandal_attacked_tree_in_Australia)" target="_top"><b>Vandal attacked tree in Australia</b></a><br><small><i>23 August 2023</i></small></h3></dt><dd>
<p>

  A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/15/vandals-damage-indigenous-birthing-tree-sacred-to-victorias-djab-wurrung-people">vandal attacked a tree in Australia</a> designated by indigenous people
SST a "birthing tree".  They are fighting a plan to eliminate that
tree to build a road which motorists consider necessary.
<p>
In my view, the religious feelings and wishes of indigenous people
should get the same level of consideration as the religious feelings
and wishes of any other people, but not more.  Regardless of which group,
such feelings do not outweigh everything else in life.
<p>
To treat something as "sacred", and extremely protected, simply
because some sect calls it so is excessive.  We would not be shocked
if some neighborhood church, mosque, synagogue, temple or shrine &mdash; or
tree &mdash; were taken by eminent domain if the purpose is sufficient.  On
the other hand, if the religious object is rare and unusual, or
specially old, that would be a stronger reason to preserve it &mdash; by
rerouting the road, in this case.
<p>
Some information crucial for evaluating this case is not present in
the article.  For instance, how many birthing trees are there per
square mile in that region?  On the average, how long have they had
the status of birthing trees?  And how long has that particular tree
enjoyed that status?
<p>
If there are many birthing trees, preserving them all is an
unreasonable demand.  If they are few, preserving them is not much to
ask, and surely feasible to do.
<p>
If that tree has been a birthing tree for 200 years, that makes it
rather special, which is a good reason to protect it.  But if it was
designated 10 years ago, it is reasonable to respond, "Pick another
tree."

<p>

  <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">Thugs</a> in Colorado <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/17/destinee-thompson-family-sue-colorado-police-fatal-shooting">shot Sestinee Thompson dead</a> as she tried to flee by
car from a confrontation.
<p>
They knew she was not the robbery suspect they were searching for, but
they wanted to grab her for completeness' sake.  That was surely not
urgent enough to justify the escalation.
<p>
That Ms Thompson had children was irrelevant; that she was pregnant
was irrelevant.  Her right to life was as valid as yours or mine, no
more and no less.
<p>
Her actions, as described by the <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a>, were very foolish, and perhaps
illegal, but they were not violent.  (We must not presume <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> are telling
the truth &mdash; <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2003-sep-dec.html#12_September_2003_(he_started_it)">often they do not</a>.)
<p>
It is quite possible that the <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> might have treated a white woman
differently.  Racism, conscious or unconscious, is not unusual.  If
they had done the same thing to a white woman, that would also have
been wrong.  We should criticize people for the cases in which they do
wrong, not for those in which they do right.
<p>
Racism is not what determines whether their actions in this case were
wrong.  It may be tangentially pertinent in explaining Ms Thompson's
over-the-top reaction to being questioned.  It may also be
partly to blame for chaotic life.
<p>
The reason the <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs'</a> actions were wrong is unrelated to the race of
the victim.  It is that shooting at someone for fleeing questioning or
arrest is an dangerous overreaction, with a significant chance of
making things much worse.  There is no need and no justification for
life-threatening hurry.

<p>

  Iranian filmmaker Saeed Roustayi has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/16/iranian-director-saeed-roustayi-jailed-cannes-film-screening-leilas-brothers">sentenced to 5 years isolation</a>
from other cinema professionals, and to take a brainwashing course in
how to make films that embody the regime's propaganda.
<p>
It occurs to me that copyright law is what enables the Iranian regime
to use threats to block the showing of Iranian's' films in other
countries.  Copyright gives the filmmakers the power to deny
permission for such showings, and thus makes it effective for the
regime to jail them if they don't deny permission.
<p>
I can imagine other countries could pass laws to permit showings
of foreign films without authorization of the copyright holder or
any other entity that "owns" some aspect, if a court finds
that a repressive regime compels that entity to deny permission.

<h3>No national identity cards</h3>
<p>
I'd like to make a list of countries that do not require a national
identity card, and have no plans to adopt one. If you live in or have
confirmed knowledge of such a country, please send email to rms at
gnu.org.

<p>
Here's my list of countries with no national ID cards
and no plans for one: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK.
Australia's previous government tried to
institute national ID cards, but the Labor government dropped
the plan.</p>

<p>India has mostly finished imposing a national biometric ID number
in a grand act of oppression.
</p>

<p>Switzerland has national ID cards which are optional,
but they or some other government ID card are needed for some purposes.
<p>
Iceland doesn't have ID cards as such, but they
have ID numbers that citizens are forced to use frequently.
For example, the national ID number is often required to
rent a video or use a gym.
</p>

<p>
Denmark issues non-photo ID cards with a "person number", and many
services use this card to identify people.
</p>

<p>
Norway will impose a national
<a href="http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Norwegian_citizens_now_required_by_law_to_give_their_fingerprint_to_the_police.html">biometric
ID card</a>.

<h3>The Lifelong Activist</h3>
<p>
People often ask how I manage to continue devoting myself to
progressive activism (such as the free software movement) for
years without burning out.  The best way I can answer is by
recommending a book, <a href="http://lifelongactivist.com">
The Lifelong Activist</a> by Hillary Rettig.

<p>I disagree with the book on one theoretical point in the last
part of the book: we shouldn't think of political activism as
<em>being</em> marketing and sales, because those terms refer to
business, and politics is something much more
important than mere business.  However, this doesn't diminish
the value of the book's practical advice about borrowing
techniques from marketing and sales.</p>
